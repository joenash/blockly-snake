## Playing with Blockly Battlesnake

- Create a new snake on Battlesnake.com
- Give it a simple name without special characters, spaces, etc
- Set the URL to be https://blockly-snake.herokuapp.com/{YOUR-SNAKE-NAME}
  - The URL for the server will be shared during the show at twitch.tv/battlesnakeofficial
  - So for example the url might be https://blockly-snake.herokuapp.com/mycoolsnake
- Navigate to https://blockly-snake.herokuapp.com/blockly
- Enter your snake name and hit "save"
- Scroll to below the Blockly editor and fill out your customization info
- Copy the [starter XML](https://gist.github.com/joenash/5deb41465886767819d1dd2f5222141b) to your clipboard and click the "paste XML" button in the Blockly editor
- If you refresh the editor, you will need to save your name again
